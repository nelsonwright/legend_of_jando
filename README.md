The Legend of Jando is a typical RPG game that is written in JavaScript.  I created it in order to try and learn JavaScript, and to show my son what sort of game could be created by an amateur hacker with no prior knowledge.

So, I'll be re-factoring as I go along, folks!

To start the game, just point your browser at: game.html

Feel free to drop me a line if you can think of any parts of the code that could be improved.  You can find me at:
